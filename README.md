## Project Title  
**Interactive Floating Circle Composition Inspired by Pacita Abadâ€™s *Wheels of Fortune***

---

## User Input Description  
Based on the group layout, I added a couple of interactive features:

1. when the mouse clicks on two circles, the two circles merge and become a new circle.

2. a little bird pattern follows the mouse.

3. when the bird pattern is close to the circle, the circle avoids the bird pattern.

4. Press keyboard 1 and the size of the circle on the screen will change randomly.
