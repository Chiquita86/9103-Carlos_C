## Project Title  
**Interactive Floating Circle Composition Inspired by Pacita Abad’s *Wheels of Fortune***

---

## Description  
This project is an interactive, dynamic visualisation inspired by Pacita Abad’s vibrant painting *Wheels of Fortune*.  
Our final piece features a canvas of non-overlapping, color-rich circles that rotate, float, and continuously evolve in response to real-time user input.  
Each circle is rendered with hand-drawn textures and dot embellishments to echo the layered, vibrant aesthetic of Abad’s work.

Below is a reference image of the original painting:

## Key Features  
- **Floating Circles:** 50 colorful, hand-drawn circles placed dynamically on the canvas, animated with a floating effect to create a sense of movement.  
- **Color Palette:** The color palette is directly extracted from *Wheels of Fortune* to retain the painting’s original mood and vibrancy.  
- **Interactivity:**  
  - **Hue Adjustment:** Use the **Hue Slider** (top left corner) to shift the hue of all circle colors.  
  - **Brightness Adjustment:** Use the **Brightness Slider** (below the Hue Slider) to control the brightness of the circles.  
- **Responsive Design:** The canvas resizes automatically to fit different window sizes.

## How to Use / View  
1. **Open the HTML file** containing the embedded JavaScript code.
2. **Interact with the sliders** at the top left of the screen:  
   - Drag the **Hue Slider** to shift the colors of the floating circles around the color wheel.  
   - Drag the **Brightness Slider** to lighten or darken the colors.  
3. **Observe the circles** rotating and floating dynamically on the screen, creating an ever-changing composition inspired by Pacita Abad’s artistic style.
Use the sliders to adjust hue and brightness, transforming the color palette in real time and discovering new variations within the same visual language, an exploration of color and texture that invites the viewer to participate in the project.

Below is an example showing the effect of adjusting the sliders:

## Technical Notes  
- The animation runs continuously without explicit “start/stop” controls.  
- **If resizing the window**, the canvas and circles automatically adjust and re-render to fit the new size.
- **If refreshing the page**, a new arrangement of circles will be generated, offering a fresh combination of positions, shapes, and textures.
